To do:
	define protocol for unsent files
	What must the pi do if one of it files fails to send?
	Keep some sort of registy of unsent in pi
	Maybe add an option to send multiple files to rand url 
		Rather than deleting dict entry

	PI Should have a last_sent register
	Pi could put unsent in temp queue folder and sent in more permanent storage folder
