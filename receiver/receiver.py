with modifications.

One can upload a file with curl using the command line:

curl -F 'sensor_data_file=@<filename.txt>' -F
    'checksum=@<chechsumfilename.sha256>' <web page address>

where:
<filename> is the name of the file to be uploaded.
<chechsumfilename> is the name of the textfile produced by running sha256sum
                   in binary mode on <filename.txt>
                   (e.g.: sha256sum -b pippo.txt > pippo.sha256).
<web page address> is the url of the upload page, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/
