Low priority:
- have booting software that runs all installation configs
- Have pi set up connection (1 to 1) to user where user can provide info for pi to connect to wifi



High priority:
Research methods for PI to communicate with computer
Test socket interface for python

Reliability:
Comm channel may be interrupted or simply no wifi for few days (keep data locally and then send all at once)
Mobile stations may not be able to have signal all the time 
Station should NEVER delete own data
Add diagnostic field to JSON that tracks raspberry pi diagnostic field with disk space info



Encrypt stuff! And authenticate
	Security:
		Make sure no one evedrops
		Make sure no one denies service (deny spammers from blocking port)
			Could check for station id and then generate new port (life ftp)


		(LOW PRIORITY)
		Injection of fake data:
			Suppose a station gets compromised
			People can get the software and deduce keys for sending fake data

			How to protect hardware??
			Encrypt file system

Assigning to each pi, a unique ID


1. Sender sends ID to server
	Server verifies id
2. Server replies with port number (or dynamic url created randomly)
3. Server opens connection on said port
	Server will know IP address of sender by this point, 
	Can listen to only this IP on new port
4. Sender sends files to new port



Home pagae must have some ID verification code
Dictionary holds all PIs talking to server atm
So new Pi connects, if ID gets verified, its id and dynamic url added to dict
Then in dynamic url, check if url in dict
	If not, refuse connection
Allow file transfer
